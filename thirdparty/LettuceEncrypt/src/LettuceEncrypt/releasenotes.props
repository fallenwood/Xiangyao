New features:
  * Add Dynamic Confing Provider for DomainNames.
  * Add LettuceEncrypt.LettuceEncryptOptionsProvider to dynamicly configure LettuceEncryptOptions.

Breaking Changes:
  * In-memory configuration provider has higher priority than explicit options.

Other:
  * Added support for .NET 8
    </PackageReleaseNotes>
    <PackageReleaseNotes Condition="$(VersionPrefix.StartsWith('1.3.'))">
New features:

  * Add support for wildcard domains by using DNS challenges to validate domain ownership
    * See https://github.com/fallenwood/LettuceEncrypt#when-using-dns-01 for details.

  * Add option (#279) and API (#281) to configure additional valid issuers
    * This is done by configuring certificates as strings. These are passed to certes internally when verifying the issuer.
      Those certificates must be parseable by https://github.com/bcgit/bc-csharp/blob/830d9b8c7bdfcec511bff0a6cf4a0e8ed568e7c1/crypto/src/x509/X509CertificateParser.cs#L20

Other:

  * Added support for .NET 6 (#280)
  * Dropped support for .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Core 3.1 (#280)
    </PackageReleaseNotes>
    <PackageReleaseNotes Condition="$(VersionPrefix.StartsWith('1.2.'))">
New features:
 * add API for configuring EAB (External Account Binding) credentials

Other:
 * Update Certes dependency to v3
 * Dropped support for .NET 5
    </PackageReleaseNotes>
    <PackageReleaseNotes Condition="$(VersionPrefix.StartsWith('1.1.'))">
New features:
 * Add API for controlling whether HTTP-01, TLS-ALPN-01, or both challenge types are used (#197)
 * create abstraction for SNI certificates in Kestrel (#108)
 * add API to configure LettuceEncrypt when also calling 'UseKestrel' to configure its HTTPS defaults or endpoints (#109)

Bug fixes:
 * workaround bug in Windows SSL stream when generating temporary self-signed certs (#110)
 * fix race condition  causing domain validation to valid sometimes. Run TLS-ALPN-01 first then HTTP-01 (if needed). Don't run in parallel (#198)
 * Don't unset other HTTPS adapters which configure a OnAuthenticate callback (#199)

Other:
 * Update package to target .NET Core 3.1 as 3.0 is no longer supported by Microsoft

Fixes in patch 1.1.1:
 * Fix infinite loop waiting for verification of domain ownership
 * Check for certificates that new renewal immediately on server startup instead of waiting 24 hours
 * Optimize loading intermediate certificate change and reduce unnecessary warnings about invalid certs

Fixes in patch 1.1.2:
 * Raise validation error if attempting to use wildcards
